            Sam (Garrett Hedlund), the son of famous video-game developer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), has been haunted for a long time by his father's mysterious disappearance. 
             A strange signal draws Sam to Flynn's Arcade, and he is pulled into the same cyberworld in which his father, its creator, has been trapped for 20 years.  
             With fearless warrior Quorra (Olivia Wilde), Kevin and Sam seek to escape from a universe that, while magnificent, is far more advanced and dangerous than Kevin had ever imagined.

            TRON:LEGACY turned out to be a visual work of art, 
            and the solid cast helped elevate the film to a higher level.  
            Definitely one I'm happy to revisit again!

                I found it to be a genuinely thrilling experience that had me whooping and hollering (in my own way). 
                Thoroughly recommended.
